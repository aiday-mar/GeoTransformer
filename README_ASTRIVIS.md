Go to: GeoTransformer/experiments/geotransformer.modelnet.rpmnet.stage4.gse.k3.max.oacl.stage2.sinkhorn/

There are two shell files:

```
test_full_deformed_current_deformation.sh
test_partial_deformed_current_deformation.sh
```
These call the file:

```
astrivis-test-multiple-transforms-2.py
```

Which applies the filtering technique used to adapt GeoTransformer to the case of non-rigid registration.
